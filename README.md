## What does your application do?
We will be creating a speed dating web application.
The purpose of this app is to aid speed dating events. This application will provide users a more personalized experience that makes them eager to find out who they matched with during speed dating events, and also encourages them to keep coming to events.
There will be two modes, an admin and a user mode.
Users will need to register through our website using their: name, email, password, age, sex, and phone number.
Users then need to pick from the available event dates.
Admin will have the ability to create post new events on the site.


## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?
Through our webside users will be able to edit their registration information, delete their accounts, add people they want a second date with, and view date matches.
The admin will be able to view everyones information from the registration questionaire, remove people from the database, and see the number of matches per event.

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?



### This repository

This repository has a package.json that functions as a blank shell that gets full credit if you turn it in to the gradescope autograder. We will not be using the autograder in any way to actually evaluate your project, it is just there to keep track of your initial submission.

We recommend that you use this repository for your final project code. This will allow you to ask questions on Piazza and get help from the TAs and instructors. Adding a real linter, type checker, etc, based on our other examples would be a good idea.
